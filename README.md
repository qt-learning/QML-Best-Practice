# QML Best Practice

Welcome to the repository for the course "QML Best Practice" on [Qt Academy](https://academy.qt.io).

## Getting Started
In this course, you will delve into the essential best practices for writing robust, maintainable, and high-performance QML code. Whether youâ€™re a developer refining your craft or stepping into the nuanced world of QML for the first time, this course will equip you with actionable insights and practical examples to elevate your projects.

The repository contains a project with a `Main.qml` file that contains commented code snippets you will explore throughout the course.

Note: The project is not required to complete the course, but is provided as a reference to help you understand the concepts discussed.

Two files from the  repository are used in the course: `Backed.qml` and `QML.png`. You can find these files in root of the repository.

## Instructions
To get started with this project, you will need to have Qt and an IDE (e.g Qt Creator) installed on your computer. You can download Qt and Qt Creator from the [Qt.io website](qt.io).

Once you have Qt and an IDE installed, head over to [Qt Academy](academy.qt.io) and follow along to create the project template and add the assets to the project.

To run the project in Qt Creator, navigate to the folder and open the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Build and run the project in Qt Creator. The application will launch and you will see the application window.
